Okay, opening Jupyter Notebook on a certain directory through Anaconda Prompt is a very common and useful thing to do!

Here's how you do it step-by-step:

Method 1: Navigate to the directory first, then launch Jupyter (Recommended)

This is generally the most straightforward way and ensures Jupyter's file browser starts exactly where you want it.

Open Anaconda Prompt:

Search for "Anaconda Prompt" in your Windows Start Menu and click to open it.

Navigate to your desired directory:

Use the cd (change directory) command.

If your directory is on the same drive:

Bash

cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyProjectFolder"
(Replace C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyProjectFolder with the actual path to your folder. Use quotes if there are spaces in the path).

If your directory is on a different drive (e.g., D: or F:):
First, change to that drive:

Bash

D:
Then, navigate to the folder on that drive:

Bash

cd "D:\Data Science Projects\Chapter1"
Launch Jupyter Notebook from that directory:
Once you are in the correct directory in the Anaconda Prompt, simply type:

Bash

jupyter notebook
and press Enter.

Jupyter Notebook will open in your web browser, and its file explorer will show the contents of the directory you navigated to.

Method 2: Launch Jupyter directly to a specified directory (Single Command)

This method allows you to specify the directory path directly when you launch Jupyter, without navigating there first.

Open Anaconda Prompt:

Search for "Anaconda Prompt" in your Windows Start Menu and click to open it.

Launch Jupyter Notebook with the --notebook-dir argument:

Bash

jupyter notebook --notebook-dir "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyProjectFolder"
(Again, replace "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyProjectFolder" with your actual path. Use quotes if there are spaces in the path.)

For different drives, make sure you provide the full path starting with the drive letter:

Bash

jupyter notebook --notebook-dir "D:\Data Science Projects\Chapter1"
Example Walkthrough:

Let's say you want to open Jupyter Notebook in a folder named MyPythonStuff located on your D: drive.

Open Anaconda Prompt.

Type D: and press Enter. (This changes the current drive to D:).

Type cd "D:\MyPythonStuff" and press Enter. (This changes the directory to your target folder).

Type jupyter notebook and press Enter.

That's it! Jupyter Notebook will now open, showing you the files and folders inside D:\MyPythonStuff.
